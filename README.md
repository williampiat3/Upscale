# Upscale
## Introduction
This work is derivated from the work of https://github.com/yu45020/Waifu2x that contains the main idea and the scripts I updated. you cna find that I kept the models, the trained weights and lots of classes that were not made from me. However I improved the implementation to speed up the upscaling process compared to video2x that processes one image at a time we offer here a way to process as many images as your VRAM allows it: make some test and this will significantly speed up the process depending on the hardware that you have.
My goal here is to suggest a methodology to upscale your movie so that you can enjoy it at a higher quality especially if the higher resolution is not available, of course you can run these programs on any computer but without a cuda capable gpu you are going to wait a lot of time.

## Requirements
Running this program can not be made out of the box and requires some piece of hardware/software

* You need ffmpeg for dealing with the videos and extract the audio, the frames and build them back together afterwards
